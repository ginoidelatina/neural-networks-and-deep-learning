# neural-networks-and-deep-learning

Hi, here are my assignments on Andrew Ng's special course "Deep Learning Specialization". This special course consists of five courses:
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)
- [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome)
- [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/home/welcome)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)
- [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)

This repository contains the contents and codes related to the course
